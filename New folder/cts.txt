Preparation tips:

Guys, you all can refer to a lot of websites for campus placement preparation, just remember that it is important to have a structured approach.
 Refer to IndiaBix for aptitude question preparation and for clarity on technical concepts, you must refer to websites like geeks to geeks and practice coding.
 After this, you must give mock tests from Oliveboard.
